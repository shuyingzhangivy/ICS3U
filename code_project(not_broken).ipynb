I think, that if I touched the earth, It would crumble; It is so sad and beautiful, So tremulously like a dream.\", \"‘A Very Short Song Poem’ by Dorothy Parker: Once, when I was young and true, Someone left me sad- Broke my brittle heart in two; And that is very bad. Love is for unlucky folk, Love is but a curse. Once there was a heart I broke; And that, I think, is worse.\", \"‘Tears, Idle Tears Poem’ by Alfred Lord Tennyson: Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean, Tears from the depth of some divine despair Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, In looking on the happy Autumn-fields, And thinking of the days that are no more. Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail, That brings our friends up from the underworld, Sad as the last which reddens over one That sinks with all we love below the verge; So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more. Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds To dying ears, when unto dying eyes The casement slowly grows a glimmering square; So sad, so strange, the days that are no more. Dear as remembered kisses after death, And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned On lips that are for others; deep as love, Deep as first love, and wild with all regret; O Death in Life, the days that are no more!\"]\n",

With a thud comes a stir in the bosom, As there steals on the sight from afar, Through a break of a cloud’s coiling shadow The gleam of a bright morning star!\", \"‘War’ by Leslie Coulson: What war has left its wake of whitened bone, Soft stems of summer grass shall wave again, And all the blood that war has ever strewn Is but a passing stain.\", \"“When My Soul Findeth Wings” by Libbie C. Baer: Like roses the bright dream did pass, On swift, noiseless footsteps away; Like glistening dew on the grass, Dissolving beneath the sun’s ray. Like voice of the lark that doth soar, Through the golden haze of the dawn; You hear it and bend to adore, Just hear it and then it is gone.\"]\n",

Listen close to the silent voice, It guides you through, your inner choice.’\", \"Whispered Hope—by Laura Whitman ‘In the quiet of your deepest night, Whispered hope will bring you light. Amid the chaos, find your calm, Let your heart be your guiding psalm. Though lost you feel, and far adrift, Your inner strength will give a lift. With every step, with every breath, You'll navigate life's path to death.’\", \"Rising Dawn—by Olivia Hart ‘When shadows fall and dreams seem lost, Hold on through the tempest's cost. For after night, the dawn will rise, A new beginning in the skies. The darkest hour, just before light, Gives way to hope, banishing fright. Each new sunrise brings a chance, To forge ahead, to join the dance.’\"]\n",
